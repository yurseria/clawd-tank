# Clawd Notification Display — TODO

## Status (v1.4.0)

Firmware builds, flashes, and runs on the Waveshare ESP32-C6-LCD-1.47 board.
BLE advertising works, notifications can be sent and dismissed via BLE GATT writes.
23 C tests pass (with ASan+UBSan), 220 Python tests pass (14 test files).
Clawd sprite animations and notification card UI are implemented.
NVS-backed config store supports brightness and session timeout with BLE read/write.
macOS menu bar app provides daemon control, device configuration UI, and simulator toggle.
Daemon supports multi-transport (BLE + TCP simulator) with dynamic add/remove at runtime.
Simulator supports TCP listener (`--listen`) for daemon-driven operation without hardware.
Tool-aware working animations — 6 distinct Clawd animations based on Claude Code tool type.
18 animated sprites integrated into scene.c, auto-cropped to tight bounding boxes.
Multi-session display with up to 4 concurrent Clawd sprites (v2 protocol).
Session state tracking in daemon with priority-based display state computation.
Staleness eviction replaces timer-based sleep — sleep is now session-driven.
Subagent lifecycle tracking prevents sleeping during long-running agent tasks.
Session state persisted to disk — restarting the app preserves display state.
Build script (`host/build.sh`) automates simulator + py2app + bundle.
Auto-update hooks, daemon health monitoring, orphan sim cleanup, launchd auto-migration.
Firmware uses RGB565A8 pixel format + cropped sprites to fit multi-session in ~200 KB SRAM (no PSRAM).
Custom app icon. Proactive BLE reconnection with full state sync on disconnect.

## Code-review hardening (attention-hooks branch) — Complete

Multi-agent review of the attention-hooks work surfaced 15 findings; fixes:

- [x] **Don't staleness-evict `waiting` sessions** — a session blocked on AskUserQuestion/
  PermissionRequest emits no events, so time-based eviction wrongly dropped the alert
  while the user was away. Now excluded from staleness eviction; PID-liveness still
  evicts a dead Claude process.
- [x] **Installer self-heals / prunes superseded groups** — `install_hooks()` now drops our
  OWN prior hook groups before re-appending the current config, so a changed matcher
  no longer leaves a stale wildcard group firing on every tool. `are_hooks_installed()`
  reports outdated when a leftover our-group sits under an unexpected matcher.
- [x] **Installer crash-guard + precise command match** — tolerates malformed `{"hooks": null}`
  groups (no TypeError); matches our notify command by exact-path/prefix, not substring
  (a user wrapper containing the path is no longer mistaken for ours).
- [x] **`waiting` outranks subagents** — a session with active subagents that hits a
  permission/question prompt now shows the alert instead of being masked by `conducting`.
- [x] **No phantom resurrection** — `permission`/`tool_failed` no longer create a missing
  session (matches `tool_done`), so a late event after SessionEnd can't revive a ghost.
- [x] **v1 alert priority** — on v1 transports `alert` (needs-you) now outranks working/
  thinking instead of being buried.
- [x] **Cleanup** — shared `ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL` constant (single source of truth),
  `_enter_state` helper removes the copy-paste state branches, `sim_main.c` `--capture-anim`
  learns `alert`, and a cross-validation test guards NOTIFY_SCRIPT↔protocol.py drift.
- Verified NOT defects / accepted limitations: the `alert` sprite loops seamlessly
  (frame 39 ≈ frame 0 — captured and checked), so no firmware change; a PermissionRequest
  alert may persist into the approved tool's run (no "granted" hook exists in Claude Code);
  `tool_failed` intentionally reuses the `confused` animation.

## "Waiting for input" alert + PostToolUse — Complete

- [x] **AskUserQuestion → waiting/alert** — When Claude shows the multiple-choice
  dialog (`AskUserQuestion` tool), its `PreToolUse` now maps to a distinct
  `waiting` session state that renders the `alert` Clawd animation, instead of the
  generic `typing` it shared with real work. Claude is blocked on the human, so it
  now looks like it.
- [x] **PostToolUse hook (scoped to AskUserQuestion)** — New `PostToolUse` hook,
  registered with `matcher: "AskUserQuestion"` to keep device event/BLE traffic
  minimal. Emits a `tool_done` daemon event that clears the `waiting` alert back to
  `thinking` the moment the user answers. The daemon-side handler is generic, so the
  matcher can be broadened later with zero code change.
- [x] **`alert` anim string parsing** — Added `"alert"` → `CLAWD_ANIM_ALERT` to both
  `ble_service.c` and `sim_ble_parse.c` `parse_anim_name()` (it was previously
  unmapped). v1 transports map the `alert` anim to the `confused` needs-attention
  status. Notify script version bumped to `2026-05-30-posttooluse` (auto-reinstalls).
- [x] **Non-clobbering hook installer** — `install_hooks()` now MERGES our hooks into
  the user's Claude Code settings instead of `dict.update()` replacing whole event
  keys. For each event+matcher we manage, our hook group is appended only if absent;
  the user's own hooks (and other settings keys) are never modified or removed.
  Idempotent. `are_hooks_installed()` is now matcher-aware so a new/changed matcher is
  correctly detected as outdated. (`tests/test_hooks_install.py`, 12 tests.)
- [x] **PermissionRequest → waiting/alert** — When Claude is blocked waiting for the
  user to approve a tool, the session enters the same `waiting`/`alert` state as
  AskUserQuestion. No "granted" hook exists and `PreToolUse` precedes it, so the alert
  clears on the next `tool_use`/`Stop`/`UserPromptSubmit`. Fires only when a permission
  dialog actually appears (auto-approved tools don't trigger it).
- [x] **PostToolUseFailure → confused** — A genuine tool error (not a non-zero shell
  exit) maps to the `confused` state — a transient "that didn't work" snag, lighter
  than the API-error `error`/dizzy state. No notification card; clears on the next
  event. Both new hooks reuse existing states/animations — no firmware/v1 changes.
  Notify script version → `2026-05-30-permission-toolfailure`.

## Working Animations (v1.1.0) — Complete

- [x] **Session state tracking in daemon** — `dict[session_id → state]` with `_compute_display_state()` priority resolution. States: registered → thinking → working → idle → confused. Display priority: working_N > thinking > confused > idle > sleeping.
- [x] **Intensity tiers** — 1 session working = Typing animation, 2 sessions = Juggling, 3+ sessions = Building.
- [x] **Hook protocol expansion** — New hooks: SessionStart, PreToolUse, PreCompact. Hook discriminator field on existing add/dismiss events for daemon-side session state differentiation.
- [x] **6 new sprite animations** — thinking (32f), typing (12f), juggling (10f), building (8f), confused (48f), sweeping (12f, oneshot). All 180×180px @ 8fps. Generated from SVG sources via svg2frames.py + png2rgb565.py pipeline.
- [x] **Fallback animation mechanism** — `scene_set_fallback_anim()` allows oneshots (alert, happy, sweeping) to return to the current working animation instead of always IDLE.
- [x] **set_status BLE/TCP action** — `display_status_t` enum with string-to-enum mapping in both firmware and simulator JSON parsers.
- [x] **Session-driven sleep model** — Timer-based sleep removed from firmware. Sleep is now daemon-driven: no sessions = sleeping. Staleness eviction (configurable timeout, default 10min) handles ungraceful session termination.
- [x] **PreCompact sweeping** — Daemon sends sweeping oneshot followed by computed state as fallback.
- [x] **Hook migration detection** — `are_hooks_installed()` checks all required hooks, not just any. Install button always updates to latest.
- [x] **Menu bar "Session Timeout"** — Renamed from "Sleep Timeout", wired to daemon staleness timeout.

## Sprites & Animations (v1.0.0) — Complete

- [x] **All 5 SVG animations converted to C sprite headers** — idle (96f/135×135), alert (40f/135×135), happy (20f/120×120), sleeping (36f/120×120), disconnected (36f/150×120). Frame buffer cap raised from 48→96. All `#if HAS_*_SPRITE` guards removed from `scene.c`. Alert and happy remain non-looping (one-shot). Idle, sleeping, disconnected loop.

## UI/UX Design (v1.0.0) — Complete

- [x] **Notification entry animation** — fade animation implemented (300ms ease-out via `lv_anim` + `lv_obj_set_style_opa`). Fade-in on show, fade-out with hide callback on dismiss. Instant path preserved for disconnect/clear.
- [x] **Transition animation** — full-screen new notification → compact list view. New notification triggers a 2.5s hero/expanded card view (fills the notification panel), then animates via `lv_anim` with `lv_anim_path_ease_in_out` over 350ms down to the compact list height. Implemented in `notification_ui.c` via `notification_ui_trigger_hero()` (called from `ui_manager.c` on `BLE_EVT_NOTIF_ADD`). Auto-rotation and repeat-hero on rapid new notifications are both handled correctly.
- [x] **Text truncation and scrolling** — featured card uses `LV_LABEL_LONG_SCROLL_CIRCULAR` marquee for both project name and message. Compact list uses `LV_LABEL_LONG_DOT` ("..."). Manual `snprintf` truncation removed.

## Simulator Improvements (v1.1.0) — Complete

- [x] **Default scale changed to 2x** — Window opens at 640×344 instead of 960×516.
- [x] **`--pinned` flag** — Always-on-top mode via `SDL_SetWindowAlwaysOnTop`.
- [x] **Auto-focus on launch** — `SDL_RaiseWindow` brings window to front.
- [x] **Shutdown freeze fix** — Client socket closed during shutdown to unblock `recv()` in listener thread.

## Python Host Hardening (v1.0.0) — Complete

- [x] **Socket length framing** (`socket_server.py`) — switched to newline-delimited messages; server uses `readline()`, sender appends `\n`
- [x] **`sys.exit(1)` in hook** (`clawd-notify`) — changed to `sys.exit(0)` with explanatory comment; notifications are best-effort
- [x] **Log file context manager** (`clawd-notify`) — `open()` now in a `with` block; handle closed even if `Popen` raises
- [x] **Broad `except Exception`** (`socket_server.py`) — `JSONDecodeError` caught separately with `logger.error`, `TimeoutError` caught explicitly with `logger.warning`, remaining unexpected errors use `logger.exception()` for full traceback

## Testing Improvements (v1.0.0) — Complete

- [x] **Add sanitizers to C test Makefile** — `-fsanitize=address,undefined -Werror` added to CFLAGS and LDFLAGS; 18/18 tests pass clean
- [x] **Test `_replay_active`** — 4 tests: sends all active, empty store, skips unknown events, concurrent mutation safe
- [x] **Test BLE write failure → reconnect → replay path** — 2 tests: single and multi-notification replay after write failure
- [x] **Test `cwd=""`** (empty string explicitly) — verified `Path("").name` triggers the `"unknown"` fallback

## Simulator-Daemon Bridge (v1.0.0) — Complete

- [x] **TCP socket listener in simulator** — background pthread with mutex-guarded ring buffer queue, newline-delimited JSON protocol matching BLE GATT format. `--listen [port]` CLI flag (default 19872). Shared JSON parser (`sim_ble_parse.c`) mirrors firmware's `parse_notification_json`.
- [x] **Multi-transport daemon architecture** — `TransportClient` Protocol, `SimClient` TCP transport, per-transport queues and sender tasks. `--sim` / `--sim-only` CLI flags. Dynamic `add_transport`/`remove_transport` methods.
- [x] **Per-transport observer status** — `on_connection_change` includes transport name. Menubar shows per-transport status lines (BLE/Simulator: Connected/Connecting...).
- [x] **Simulator toggle in menubar** — "Enable Simulator" checkable menu item with preference persistence (`~/.clawd-tank/preferences.json`). Dynamically adds/removes sim transport at runtime.
- [x] **Initial replay on connect** — `_transport_sender` replays active notifications after initial connect, so dynamically-added transports show existing notifications.
- [x] **Stop hook support** — `protocol.py` handles Stop hook event to show "Waiting for input" notification immediately when Claude stops.

## Code Quality (v1.0.0) — Complete

- [x] **Document `_lock_t` locking intent** (`ui_manager.c`) — comment explaining the lock covers both `rebuild_ui()` and `lv_timer_handler()`
- [x] **Comment `display_init()` return** (`main.c:42`) — return value intentionally discarded; LVGL tracks default display internally
- [x] **LVGL mutex migration** — added TODO comment in `ui_manager.c` noting the `lv_lock()`/`lv_unlock()` migration consideration and flush-ready integration concern

## Subagent Tracking (v1.2.0) — Complete

- [x] **SubagentStart/SubagentStop hooks** — New hooks registered and forwarded to daemon via the hook handler script.
- [x] **Per-session subagent tracking** — `subagents: set[agent_id]` tracked per session in daemon state dict.
- [x] **Eviction suppression** — Sessions with active subagents are never evicted by staleness checker.
- [x] **Display state integration** — Sessions with active subagents count as "working" in display state computation, preventing Clawd from sleeping during long subagent tasks.

## Session State Persistence (v1.2.0) — Complete

- [x] **Atomic session state save/load** — `save_sessions()`/`load_sessions()` in `session_store.py` serialize session state dict to `~/.clawd-tank/sessions.json` with set↔list conversion. Atomic writes via temp file + `os.replace`.
- [x] **Smart persistence** — Session state saved only on structural changes (state transitions, subagent add/remove), not on every `last_event` timestamp update. Reduces disk writes during heavy tool use.
- [x] **Daemon startup recovery** — Loads saved sessions on init with immediate staleness eviction. Restarting the menu bar app immediately shows correct animation for running Claude Code sessions.

## Daemon Resilience (v1.2.1) — Complete

- [x] **Auto-update hooks on startup** — Hooks are checked and updated automatically on app launch when outdated, removing the need for manual "Install Hooks" clicks after code updates.
- [x] **Daemon thread crash logging** — Daemon thread exceptions are caught and logged instead of dying silently. Periodic health check timer detects dead daemon and shows disconnected icon.
- [x] **Orphaned sim process cleanup** — On startup, orphaned simulator processes on the listen port are identified by name and killed instead of being connected to.
- [x] **Display state sync on replay** — `_last_display_state` is updated after transport replay to prevent duplicate broadcasts.
- [x] **Proactive BLE reconnection** — Transport sender loop detects dropped connections on each 1s timeout and immediately reconnects with full state sync (time, protocol version, notifications, sessions) instead of waiting for the next hook message.

## Multi-Session Display (v1.3.0) — Complete

- [x] **Multi-session display** — Up to 4 concurrent Clawd sprites with per-session animations. Protocol v2 `set_sessions` action with stable UUIDs. Overflow badge shows "+N" beyond `MAX_VISIBLE=4`.
- [x] **Walk-in animation** — New sessions enter from offscreen with a walking sprite. Existing sessions reposition with walk animations on layout change.
- [x] **Going-away burrowing animation** — Exiting sessions play a burrowing animation. Remaining sessions defer repositioning until burrowing completes.
- [x] **HUD subagent counter** — 2x-scaled mini-crab icon with pixel-art bitmap font shows active subagent count. Overflow badge anchored to right edge.
- [x] **Per-session sweeping** — `PreCompact` sends sweep animation only to the compacting session (v2), global sweep preserved for v1 fallback.
- [x] **Protocol version negotiation** — BLE GATT characteristic exposes protocol version (v2). Daemon reads on connect, selects v1 `set_status` or v2 `set_sessions` per-transport.
- [x] **`query_state` TCP action** — Debug introspection returning JSON with slot states, animations, and positions.
- [x] **Simulator window improvements** — Continuous float scaling, aspect ratio enforcement (328:180), uniform LED border rendering, borderless/resizable window with integer pixel scaling.
- [x] **Custom app icon** — macOS app icon with Clawd pixel-art crab design. SVG source and full iconset in `assets/`.

## Sprite Auto-Crop & Firmware Memory Optimization (v1.3.0) — Complete

- [x] **Auto-crop sprite pipeline** — `tools/crop_sprites.py` reads existing C headers, decodes all frames, finds tight bounding box, applies symmetric horizontal + free vertical crop, re-encodes RLE, writes headers in-place. `tools/analyze_sprite_bounds.py` for analysis.
- [x] **All 14 sprites cropped** — Frame buffer savings: 1194 KB → 368 KB (69%). Largest session sprite: confused 152x113 (50 KB). Idle: 72x51 (11 KB). Walking: 60x40 (7 KB).
- [x] **RGB565A8 firmware pixel format** — Frame buffers use 3 bytes/pixel (LVGL native-with-alpha for 16-bit display) instead of 4 bytes/pixel ARGB8888. New `rle_decode_rgb565a8` decoder.
- [x] **Firmware slot limits** — `MAX_VISIBLE=4`, `MAX_SLOTS=6` on firmware (no PSRAM). Simulator retains `MAX_SLOTS=8`.
- [x] **y_offset adjustments** — All `anim_defs` y_offset values recomputed: `new = old - bottom_rows_removed`.
- [x] **Firmware build fixes** — `pixel_font.c` added to CMakeLists, format specifier warnings fixed, unused code suppressed.
- [x] **Heap diagnostics** — Free heap logged at boot. OOM logging in `ensure_frame_buf`.
- [x] **PSRAM correction** — ESP32-C6FH8 has no PSRAM. Removed bogus settings from `sdkconfig.defaults`, corrected CLAUDE.md.

## WT32-SC01 Plus Port (in progress)

- [x] **Firmware ported to WT32-SC01 Plus** — ESP32-S3, 480x320 ST7796U over 8-bit i80 parallel bus (branch `feat/wt32-sc01-plus-port`).
- [x] **PSRAM config corrected** — WT32-S3 module has 2MB Quad PSRAM (not 8MB Octal); `sdkconfig.defaults` fixed. LVGL render buffers moved to internal DMA SRAM (i80 DMA path).
- [x] **Display corruption root-caused and fixed** — panel needs `invert_color(true)` (IPS), BGR element order, and landscape mirror `(false,false)` with `swap_xy`; byte swap moved to i80 `swap_color_bytes` hardware flag; PCLK restored to 20MHz. Matches verified WT32-SC01 Plus BSP config.
- [x] **Screen-freeze root-caused: GPIO8 conflict** — `rgb_led.c` (C6 onboard WS2812) initialized RMT on GPIO8, which is LCD data line DB3 on WT32-SC01 Plus. This stole the pin from LCD_CAM after boot, corrupting every subsequent panel write (boot-time draws worked; LVGL flushes after `rgb_led_init` never displayed). RGB LED now disabled on this board.
- [x] **Verified on hardware** — scene renders correctly (colors, orientation, time, crab animation) with BLE connected via `tools/ble_interactive.py`. Temporary flush-trace logging removed.
- [ ] **UX: disconnected/idle scene is nearly invisible** — night sky `0x0a0e1a` + gray-recolored crab reads as "screen off" on the 3.5" panel. Consider brightening the scene or the disconnected hint text for this board.

## Future Considerations (Out of Scope)

- Physical button interaction (dismiss notifications from the device)
- Multiple host device support (pairing with more than one Mac)
- OTA firmware updates over WiFi
- Per-session project name display during working animations
